Self-contained Data Loading Script
==================================

## Introduction

This repo contains self-contained Python scripts for loading common benchmark
datasets, with minimum dependencies.  Most of them expose the `load_data` API to
use.  Some of these scripts could also be found in other machine learning
packages, e.g., [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras).  However, I sometime may just want to load the data
without using the package at all.
